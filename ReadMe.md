## Quick Start

Buddy Pond is free use at: [https://buddypond.com](https://buddypond.com)

## Built-in Help Commands

Once you've loaded Buddy Pond you can type the following commands to get help:

**Display chat commands**

Type `/help` in any chat window to get help.

**`BuddyScript` Commands**

Type `/bs` in any chat window to see `BuddyScript` commands.


`BuddyScript` is an integrated scripting languge in Buddy Pond that allows you to fully control the Desktop Application and all Apps through chat commands.

## Developers Guide

If you wish to develop a custom application for Buddy Pond, you can use our BuddyApp template located at:

[https://github.com/buddypond/app-template](https://github.com/buddypond/app-template)

This `app-template` will allow you to upload new BuddyApps directly from your Github Repository which are then hosted in your BuddyFiles storage.

## Modifying Buddy Pond Core / Based Applications

The latest version of Buddy Pond can be located in the `/v5` directory.

BuddyPond consists of two main parts:

  - A small core `bp.js` which is responsible for dynamically loading all assets and apps such as:  `desktop`, `ui`, `buddylist`, etc.
  - The `v5/apps/based` folder which contains a directory of all Apps

In most cases you will you want to modify an existing app in `v5/apps/based`, as `bp.js` is a thin wrapper only repsonsible for minimal core loading responsiblites.

## Starting a local development server

Run `vite` in the root directory to start a local development server where you can access `http://localhost:5173/`
