        <h1>What is Buddy Pond?</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Buddy Pond is an Open-Source Cloud Desktop and Peer to Peer Instant Messenger.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <h2>What can Buddy Pond Do?</h2>
        <p>
          Buddy Pond can basically do anything a modern Desktop Operating System can do. Try clicking around the Desktop to discover new functionality. Invite another Buddy to join and try out the Remix Multimedia Chats.
        </p>
        
        <br/>

              <img class="desktopImage" src="desktop/assets/images/misc/preview_desktop.png" alt="Peer to Peer Instant Messaging" >
            </a>
            <div class="desc">Cloud Desktop. Still works offline</div>

        <div style="clear:both;"></div>
       <br/>

       <h2>Why build such a thing?</h2>
        <p>
        We have predicted the future and can see Microsoft and Apple Operating Systems only becoming worse for the users. There will be little to no offline support and users will be forced into paying monthly subscription fees in order to have access to their "Virtual Cloud Computer".
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Performing any basic functionality like ordering a pizza or writing a Word document will be a draconian experience. Overall quality of User Experience will continue to decline and humans will suffer from not being able to pay their Microsoft Live Subscriptions.
      </p>
     <br/>

     <h2>How can I download my own Buddy Pond?</h2>

     <p>Buddy Pond works locally first. It's your own Cloud. The entire Desktop experience is ready to go immediately without having to wait.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
      You can download our Companion App: <a href="https://github.com/Marak/mybuddy">MY BUDDY</a> right now and everything works offline and stores your files locally.
     </p>

     <br/>
     <h2>What is the Buddy Pond AppStore?</h2>

     <p>
       The Buddy Pond AppStore is a library of community contributed Apps specifically built, tested, and designed for Buddy Pond. It's still in Alpha and we have over 9000 Apps in testing.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p> If you'd like to see your App added please message us in the <a href="#" class="openApp" data-app="pond" data-context="Alpha">#Alpha Pond</a>.

      <h3>We would like to be able to manage our devices, our businesses, and our home and office networks without being dependant on any Internet or Cloud Providers.</h3>
      <br/>
      <h3>We would like to have all our favorite apps ( Chat / Social / Work / Music Production / Gaming / Art / Visual Effects ) all one place.</h3>
