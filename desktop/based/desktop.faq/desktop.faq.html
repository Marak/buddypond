        <h1>What is Buddy Pond?</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Buddy Pond is an Open-Source Cloud Operating System and Peer to Peer Instant Messenger. Buddy Pond is extensible through its integrated <a href="#" class="openApp" data-app="appstore">App Store</a> which allows developers to submit and sell applications.
        </p>

        <h2>What can Buddy Pond Do?</h2>
        <p>
          Buddy Pond can basically do anything a modern Desktop Operating System can do. Try clicking around the Desktop or <a href="#" class="openApp" data-app="appstore">App Store</a> to discover new functionality. Invite another Buddy to join and try out the Multimedia Chats.
        </p>

       <br/>

       <h2>Why build such a thing?</h2>
        <p>
        The trend of operating systems that dominate the market is they are becoming worse for the users. There will be little to no offline support and users will be forced into paying monthly subscription fees in order to have access to their "Virtual Cloud Computer".
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Performing any basic functionality like ordering a pizza or writing a Word document will be a draconian experience. Overall quality of User Experience will continue to decline and users will suffer from not being able to pay their Microsoft Live Subscriptions.
      </p>
     <br/>
      <p>
        Buddy Pond utilizes the ever growing power of the browser and technologies like Web Assembly to delivery a fresh take on open Cloud Operating systems that can instantly load on any browser-ready device. Having full vertical control of the application stack allows Buddy Pond to deliver a unified experience unparralled amongst current Operating Systems and App Stores.
      </p>
      <br/>

     <h2>How can I download my own Buddy Pond?</h2>

     <p>Buddy Pond works locally first. It's your own Cloud. The entire Desktop experience is ready to go immediately without having to wait.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
      You can download our Companion App: <a href="https://github.com/Marak/mybuddy">MY BUDDY</a> right now and Buddy Pond will  work offline and with your data stored locally.
     </p>

     <br/>
     <h2>What is the Buddy Pond AppStore?</h2>

     <p>
       The Buddy Pond AppStore is a library of community contributed Apps specifically built, tested, and designed for Buddy Pond. It's still in Alpha and we have over 9000 Apps in testing.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p> If you'd like to see your App added please message us in the <a href="#" class="openApp" data-app="pond" data-context="Alpha">#Alpha Pond</a>.
     </p>

     <br/>
     <h2>What are the goals of Buddy Pond?</h2>
     <br/>
      <p>Our goal is to have all our favorite apps ( Chat / Social / Work / Music Production / Gaming / Art / Visual Effects ) in one easily accessible place. We want a singular destination to manage our devices, our businesses, and our home and office networks.</p>

      <br/>
      <p>
        We want to be able to easily communicate with friends, colleagues, and family. We want to turn on our gaming system and not be forced to update for three hours on a Sunday morning. We want to know that in twenty years time all of this will still work exactly the same.
