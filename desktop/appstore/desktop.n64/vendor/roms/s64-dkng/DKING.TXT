Introduction
------------

Dragon King is a RPG which was inspired by the old NES game Dragon
Warrior.You play a young knight who must save the realm of Eloria
from the Dragon King and his army of monsters.


Saving
------

The game uses EEPROM to save. The menu after the title screen will only
have the option to continue a game if a Dragon King save is detected
in EEPROM. You can save your progress at any of the towns by going to
the Inn.


Difficulty
----------

There are three levels of difficulty: 'Normal' is the original
difficulty, 'Harder' makes monsters more accurate and 'Hardest' makes
monsters more accurate and stronger.


Controls
--------

Use the control pad to move around.

Press START to see your status which also pauses the game.Press START
again to resume playing.

The A or B button is the 'action' button. It's used to talk, select items
from a menu, advance through text windows and open chests.

     
Playing the game
----------------

Your ultimate goal is to destroy the Dragon King.But you will need
experience in combat.As you travel around Eloria you will encounter
many monsters.By fighting and successfully defeating these monsters,
you will gain experience and gold.As you gain experience you also gain
levels which will make you slightly stronger.The type and difficulty
of the monsters you run into depends on the type of terrain you are
traveling on and also where you are in the world.

Your health is represented by Hit Points or HP.There is a limit on the
amount of Hit Points you can have which is your Maximum HP.This rises
each time you gain an experience level.Anytime your HP drops to 0 or
below, you will die.You can continue playing but are penalized by losing
half your experience points and half your gold.


Fighting
--------

When you encounter a monster a menu will appear allowing you to Fight,
use Items or Run.

When you select Fight you will attack the monster.

Selecting Items will bring up another menu showing how many Herbs or
Potions you have.An herb adds half of your Maximum HP to your current
HP.A Potion completely heals you.Select the item you want to use from
the menu or select "Nevermind" to cancel and go back to the fight menu.

By choosing Run, you will try to run away from the monster.

After you select an action, the monster will attack.The process keeps
repeating until either the monster or you have died.
