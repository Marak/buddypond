Puzzle Master 64

Here is a real simple game. Its basically just a simple slide
type puzzle game. (you know, where you have to unscramble the
picture by moving the pieces around). Theres an in-game help
screen by pressing the START button, which will give a run
down of all the buttons and what they do.

Sorry about the huge size, but the game does have over 40+ high
resolution pictures jammed into it. Theres even a cheat in the
game if you can figure out what it is. :-)
(a little hint; try a button/joystick combo at the main screen)
If anyone is interested, I did do another version of the game
with a different "theme" to the pictures which I'll release if
there is enough interest in it.

This game has only been tested on a v64. I also don't know if
it will work with any of the emulators out there either... sorry.

Some things I would of liked to of added;
some background music and sound.
maybe some multiplayer.

If you have any problems, please feel free to contact me.
