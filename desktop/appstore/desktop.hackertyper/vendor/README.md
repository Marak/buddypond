## HackerTyper

[hackertyper.net](https://hackertyper.net) is the original HackerTyper that was created back in 2011 as a fun little project. 

Contributions are welcome but I am looking more at maintaining the project as a token more than improving on it(even if a lot of improvements could be made)
