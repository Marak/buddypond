ݲ     Manic Miner for the N64 whatever next??                      
ݲ                                                                  
ݲ     This is my SUMMER64 entry and it rules, so there...          
ݲ                                                                  
ݲ     Orignaly I was going to produce a collection of all 3        
ݲ     Miner Willy games, Manic Miner, Jet Set Willy & Jet Set      
ݲ     Willy II (to be called "Willy All Stars" :> ) but as I never 
ݲ     managed to get the time to complete the second two Its just  
ݲ     Manic Miner.  I might complete the pack and convert the      
ݲ     other two games at some point and complete the pack, but     
ݲ     I'm not sure if I can be bothered :>                         
ݲ                                                                  
ݲ     I also might get around to one day adding support for the    
ݲ     Rummble Pack and Memory Pak as I had orginaly intened...     
ݲ                                                                  
ݲ     Anyway, Its 4am and I'm off to bed.. have fun with the       
ݲ     game.....
