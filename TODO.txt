1/2 - investigate local yt player not working for certain videos?

  issue seems related to specific youtube ids not working on file://
  current work-around is to use http server for localhost
  possible work-around for local is to destroy and remove youtube iframe per video load

  mtvPlayer.loadVideoById('1m-KtU88K9Y')
  mtvPlayer.loadVideoById('pNGEqGvz-ds')
